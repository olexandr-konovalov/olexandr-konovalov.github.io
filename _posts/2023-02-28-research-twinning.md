I am helping to organise [*the first Digital Theme Research
Twinning conference*](https://digital-ukraine.co.uk/).
Our objective is to help Ukrainian academics to integrate
into the international research network and to find new
research contacts. This online event will take place
on the week beginning 27 March 2023 and will include
invited talks, lightning talks, virtual poster sessions,
and other activities. The deadline for submitting short
talks and posters is 6th of March 2023. 

Please see [https://digital-ukraine.co.uk/](https://digital-ukraine.co.uk/)
for further details.

**Update:** BCS has published an article about this conference, [available here](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/digital-collaboration-between-uk-and-ukraine/).
