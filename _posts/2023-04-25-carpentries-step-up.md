Ukrainian students at the University of St Andrews are invited to apply
to the Summer Teams Enterprise Programme (STEP) 2023 to work on Ukrainian
translation of the teaching materials by
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) - a global volunteer-based
organisation whose members teach foundational coding and data science
skills to researchers worldwide.

The project is open to all students who know Ukrainian, and would be
especially attractive to those with an interest in the
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) curriculum. You do not have
to be an expert in the area, since the materials are designed for beginners,
and you will learn in the process. There is also the
[Carpentries Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)
which is not relying on technical skills at all, but introduces the reader
to evidence-based teaching practices and explains the foundations of the
Carpentries teaching methodology.

Please see further details and application instructions on 
the [STEP 2023 programme website](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/ceed/summer-enterprise-programme/)
(scroll to the "Software Carpentry for Ukraine" in the list of project to see the project description).
Some information is also available in [my earlier post here](https://olexandr-konovalov.github.io/posts/2023/03/28/carpentries-translation/).
