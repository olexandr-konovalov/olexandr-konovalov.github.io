I will give a talk "Showcasing computational experiments" at the CIRCA
lunchtime seminar on 25th October 2018.

Abstract: Have you been frustrated by trying to use someone else's code
which is non-trivial to install? Have you tried to make supplementary
code for your paper to be easily accessible for the reader? If so, you
certainly know that this may require non-trivial efforts. However, it's
2018, and there are some new tools available. These tools can make this
process simpler, for example, for a potential reader and/or reviewer of
your paper. I will demonstrate how to use these tools to create a
reproducible computational experiment with GAP, and will explain which
skills will be needed for that. You are welcome to bring your laptop to
try to access and reproduce some experiments that are already presented
in this way.
