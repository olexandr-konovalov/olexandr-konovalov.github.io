Today I will give a talk at the [__Code & Cake discussion group__](https://code-and-cake.github.io/).
I will be discussing the paper [__Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Research in Jupyter Notebooks__](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08055)
by Adam Rule et al., and my talk will be given using the very technology about which I will be speaking.
The slides for this talk are contained in [__this Jupyter notebook__](https://github.com/olexandr-konovalov/repro-jupyter/blob/master/notebooks/JupyterNotebooksForReproducibleResearch.ipynb), which will be launched on [Binder](https://mybinder.org)
from [__this GitHub repository__](https://github.com/olexandr-konovalov/repro-jupyter). The Jupyter notebook will be translated into
a `reveal.js`-based presentation using the Jupyter extension called [__RISE__](https://rise.readthedocs.io).
