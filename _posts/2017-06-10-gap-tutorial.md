I am co-organising a 
**[GAP Tutorial in Birmingham](https://www.codima.ac.uk/gsta2017/)**
on August 13th-14th. It will immediately follow 
[Groups St Andrews 2017 in Birmingham](http://www.groupsstandrews.org/2017/),
and I hope that some participants will be interested to stay for it.
Participation is open to everyone, and there is a limited financial support 
available to PhD students from UK Universities, provided by
[CCP CoDiMa](https://www.codima.ac.uk/). Please see 
*[this page](https://www.codima.ac.uk/gsta2017/)* for further details
and registration link.
