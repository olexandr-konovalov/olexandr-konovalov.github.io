I am a lecturer in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/)
of the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), where
I am leading the [Research Software Group](https://rse.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/),
focussed on interdisciplinary computational research and development of underpinning
research software, training in scientific computing, and studies in research software
aspects.

I am a Fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/),
and an [Instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) and
a [Trainer](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) for [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/),
where I am also coordinating the [Ukrainian Carpentries Community](https://ukrainian-carpentries.github.io/)
and participating in the [Carpentries in St Andrews](https://carpentries.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/).

I am also an editor of several journals publishing on research software:
the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/),
the [Journal of Open Research Software](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/),
and the [Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry](https://msp.org/jsag/).

A pure mathematician by training, I have completed PhD in algebra and number theory at the
[Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine](https://imath.kiev.ua/).
After that, I started to work with (and eventually to contribute to) an open-source system [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/), used for research and teaching in the study of groups and their
representations, rings, algebras, semigroups, combinatorial structures,
and other discrete mathematical objects.

Joining the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Computational Algebra](https://circa.st-andrews.ac.uk/) as a Research Fellow, for more than a decade
I was actively involved in everyday aspects
of GAP development, including release management, regression tests,
liaising with package authors, as well as technical support and user training. I worked on the
EU Framework 6 project 26133 "SCIEnce - Symbolic Computation Infrastructure for Europe",
EPRSC-funded projects HPC-GAP and [CCP CoDiMa â€“ Collaborative Computational Project in Computational Discrete Mathematics](https://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/codima/),
and also the [Horizon 2020 OpenDreamKit project](https://opendreamkit.org/).
I am a member of the [GAP Council](https://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/Council/council.html)
and the [GAP Support group](https://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/supportgroup.html).
